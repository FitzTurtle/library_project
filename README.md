My attempt at the odin library project

All books are stored in array and fed from there

created a book constructor

created addBookToLibrary() function

Added new book functionality using a dialog modal.

Can remove a book by clicking the trashcan icon

Can mark a book as read by clicking the book icon by creating method on book Prototype.

Storage not required yet.
